A simple web application with user registration, login functionality, and a basic dashboard.

# ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amit-ga/User-Authentication-System.git <desired-folder-name>
cd <folder-name>
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React with Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start  # opens on http://localhost:3000

## Additional Notes
- The frontend uses **PrimeReact** + **PrimeFlex** for UI components and styling.
- The backend uses **Flask** with **JWT** authentication and **bcrypt** for password hashing.
- JWT is decoded in the frontend to get the logged-in userâ€™s email.
- Frontend form validation (password strength, matching fields) is performed before submission.
- Backend also validates credentials to ensure they havenâ€™t been tampered with during transmission from the frontend.
  Additionally, it uses the email_validator library, which performs both syntax and domain verification for email addresses.
- Protected dashboard route only loads if a valid token is stored in localStorage.
